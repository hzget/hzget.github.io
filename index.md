# Intro

A software engineer with years of experiences on network devices.

Interests:

* Network Protocols
* Artificial Intelligence
* Programming and Debugging

The blog is intended to keep track of the learning progress
and review some knowledge learnt in the past.

## Network Protocols

Devices on the networks talk with each other.
Network protocols make the rule of the dialogue.
It tells who can send which command and who will respond.
For example, the server may request status of the client
and the client may respond with that info.

In my past jobs, I worked with the following two protocols.
They're used as the machanism to manage network devices:
auto-configuration, status collection and so on.

[Netconf/Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NETCONF) - RFC 6241, RFC 7950 by IETF  
[CWMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-069) - TR069 by Broadband Forum  
Security: ssh, https

## Aritificial Intelligence

AI plays an increasingly important role in the society and
deserves great attention. If we don't care about it, we'll be
replaced before long. To avoid being defected by AI,
we can join hands with it.

### Intuition

The following two links just give an ***intuition*** about
what ML looks like and how it works under the hood.

[Machine Learning](./ml_tutorials/ml_tutorials.md):
A technique that learns rules from examples automatically,
which can be applied on new cases.  
[Neural Networks](./neural_networks_intuition/neural_networks.md):
A subfield of ML. An implementation:
[online handwritten recognition](./neural_networks_intuition/implementation.md).

### Tutorials

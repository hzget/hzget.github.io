## intro

Hello, I'm a software engineer and live in shanghai currently.
I'm interested in machine learning and deep learning and I write blogs about it.
Welcome to discuss with me!

I begin with a tutorial video created by ***Josh Gordon*** and
write a blog about what I get from it.

After that I will read the book ***Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow***
and then record the progress.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/hzget/hzget.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/hzget/hzget.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

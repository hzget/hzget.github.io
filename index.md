# Intro

A software engineer with years of experiences on network devices.

Interests:

* Network Protocols
* Artificial Intelligence
* Programming and Debugging

The blog is intended to keep track of the learning progress
and review some knowledge learnt in the past.

## Network Protocols

Devices on the networks talk with each other.
Network protocols make the rule of the dialogue.
It tells who can send which command and who will respond.
For example, the server may request status of the client
and the client may respond with that info.

In my past jobs, I worked with the following two protocols.
They're used as the machanism to manage network devices:
auto-configuration, status collection and so on.

[Netconf/Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NETCONF) - RFC 6241, RFC 7950 by IETF  
[CWMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-069) - TR069 by Broadband Forum  
Security: ssh, https

## Aritificial Intelligence

AI plays an increasingly important role in the society and
deserves great attention. If we don't care about it, we'll be
replaced before long. To avoid being defected by AI,
we can join hands with it.

I have written tutorials to introduce two topics in AI:
[Machine Learning tutorial](./ml_tutorials/ml_tutorials.md) and
[Neural Networks tutorial](./neural_networks/neural_networks.md).
Machine Learning is a technique that learns rules from examples automatically.
Neural Networks makes a good job as a subfield of ML.
These two tutorials just give an ***intuition*** about what ML looks like
and how it works under the hood. The neural networks tutorial also gives
an implementation to recognize hand-written digit:
[online handwritten recognition](./neural_networks/implementation.md).

I have written another tutorial to introduce what
a professional engineer deals with in his actual work:
[Machine Learning tech](./ml_tech/ml_tech.md).

# Intro

A software engineer with years of experience on network devices
as a C programmer.

Interests:

* Protocols
* AI
* Math

To keep track of the learning progress and some thoughts, I start the blog.

## Maching Learning & Deep Learning

I begin ML introduction with a tutorial video created by ***Josh Gordon*** and
record what I get & think from it.
And then begin the first step on **Neural Networks and Deep learning**, just
learn about the basic concepts and underlying principle.

To have a deep understanding and a practical experience, I will investigate
topics of the book ***Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow***.

## Math Learning

I read some math books and write what I like.

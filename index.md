# Intro

Hello, I'm a software engineer and living in shanghai.
I have many years of experience on network devices as a C programmer.
Now, I'm studying the field of Machine Learning and Deep learning.
Welcome to discuss with me!

To keep track of the process, I start the blog.

## Maching Learning & Deep Learning

I begin ML introduction with a tutorial video created by ***Josh Gordon*** and
record what I get & think from it.
And then begin the first step on **Neural Networks and Deep learning**, just
learn about the basic concepts and underlying principle.

To have a deep understanding and a practical experience, I will investigate
topics of the book ***Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow***.

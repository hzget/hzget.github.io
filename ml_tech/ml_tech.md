# Machine Learning tech

The previous tutorials [Machine learning](../ml_tutorials/ml_tutorials.md)
and [Neural Networks](../neural_networks/neural_networks.md) give
an intuition about what ML looks like and how it works under the hood.
Now we will turn to topics about what a professional engineer deals with
in his actual works:

## [Generalization Errors](./generaliztion_errors.md)

The end goal of ML is to make the trained model
perform well on new cases (in production).
Thus we need to find ways to reduce the generalization
error: Bias, Variance and Irreducible errors (i.e., fix
the underfitting and overfitting issue).

## [Challenges of Machine Learning](./challenges.md)

Most works of ML project are to resolve the challenges:
bad data, bad algorithms, performance, and so on.

## ML Workflow

We shall automate the whole process as much as possible.
Pack these steps in one pipeline and run the pipeline
with one command.

In fact it's an iterative process:
once we get the pipeline up and running,
we can anaylze outputs of some steps to gain
more insight, and then come back to the whole
exploration steps to make some improvement.
Repeat the process until we get an accepted performance.

# Machine Learning tech

The previous tutorials [Machine learning](../ml_tutorials/ml_tutorials.md)
and [Neural Networks](../neural_networks/neural_networks.md) give
an intuition about what ML looks like and how it works under the hood.
Now we will turn to topics about what a professional engineer deals with
in his actual works:

## [Generalization Errors](./generaliztion_errors.md)

The end goal of ML is to make the trained model
perform well on new cases (in production).
Thus we need to find ways to reduce the generalization
error: Bias, Variance and Irreducible errors (i.e., fix
the underfitting and overfitting issue).

## [Challenges of Machine Learning](./challenges.md)

Most works of ML project are to resolve the challenges:
bad data, bad algorithms, performance, and so on.

## [ML Workflow](./ml_workflow.md)

The whole process of ML includes data preparation,
cross-validation, fune-tuning the model, and so on.

Pack these steps in one pipeline and run the pipeline
with one command.

## [Algorithms](./algorithms/algorithms.md)

Having a good understanding of how algorithms work can
help you quickly home in appropriate model, the right
training algorithm to use, and a good set of hyperparams
for the task. Furthermore, the engineers can
make some improvement of the algorithms for specific tasks.

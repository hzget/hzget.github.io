# Machine Learning tech

The previous tutorials [Machine learning](../ml_tutorials/ml_tutorials.md)
and [Neural Networks](../neural_networks/neural_networks.md) give
an intuition about what ML looks like and how it works under the hood.
Now we will turn to topics about what a professional engineer deals with
in his actual works:

## [Generalization Errors](./generaliztion_errors.md)

The end goal of ML is to make the trained model
perform well on new cases (in production).
Thus we need to find ways to reduce the generalization
error: ***Bias, Variance and Irreducible*** (i.e., fix
the underfitting and overfitting issue).

## [Challenges of Machine Learning](./challenges.md)

Most works of ML project are to resolve the challenges:
bad data, bad algorithms, performance, and so on.

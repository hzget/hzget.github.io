# Challenges of ML

Machine Learning is a techonique to learn rules
from examples (the data) automatcially. Thus there
are mainly two important things to deal with:

* data (the examples)
* algorithms (how to learn rules)

***Most works of ML project are to resolve the challenges*** :
bad data, bad algorithms, performance, and so on.

## bad data

* Nonrepresentative training data. (sampling noise & sampling bias)
* Poor-quality data (outliers, errors, noise) solution: data cleaning
* Irrelevant features. solution: feature engineering
  
## bad algorithms

Bad algorithm means that the model has the
overfitting and/or underfitting issue.

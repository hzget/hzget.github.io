# Block Chain

From wikipedia, a [blockchain][blockchain] is
a growing list of records, called blocks, that are
linked together using cryptography. It makes use
of ***hash value*** to get the integrity and avoid
being tempered by illegal user.

## [#Naivechain][naivechain]

[Naivechain][naivechain] is a simple and excellent tutorial to begin
the tour of blockchain.

Just as naivechain said, all the current
implementations of blockchains are tightly coupled with the larger context
and problems they (e.g. Bitcoin or Ethereum) are trying to solve.
This makes understanding blockchains a necessarily harder task,
than it must be. Especially source-code-wisely.

By contrast, naivechain gives a simple intuition
of the concept of blockchain. It removes the
concepts or code of infrastructure of some specific application.

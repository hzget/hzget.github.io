# Block Chain

From wikipedia, a [blockchain][blockchain] is
a growing list of records, called blocks, that are
linked together using cryptography. It makes use
of ***hash value*** to get the integrity and avoid
being tempered by illegal user.

Just as [naivechain][naivechain] said, all the current
implementations of blockchains are tightly coupled with the larger context
and problems they (e.g. Bitcoin or Ethereum) are trying to solve.
This makes understanding blockchains a necessarily harder task,
than it must be. Especially source-code-wisely.

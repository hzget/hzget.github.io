# Summary

Machine Learning is the study of algrithm to learn from examples
and experiece.

Traditional method is that a programmer finds patterns
from examples and writes hard code rules to resolve the problem.
If there are new patterns or new problems, he has to repeat the
whole process.

The ML method is that ML app finds patterns from examples and
create a classifier that will resolve the problem. If there're
new examples or new problems, ML app just train the classifier again.
That's all. The ML app substitutes for the programmer.

To get a good classifier, we need to find good features,
handle training/testing dataset properly, and find a good algrithm.

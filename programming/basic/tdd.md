Test-Driven Development (TDD)
===

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is a software development methodology in which tests are written before the actual code. This approach is used to guide the development process, ensuring that the code meets the requirements from the very beginning.

### Key Steps in Test-Driven Development

1. **Write a Test**:
   - Start by writing a test for the next small piece of functionality you want to add.
   - The test should define a specific requirement or behavior that the code should have.
   - At this stage, the test will likely fail since the functionality hasn't been implemented yet.

2. **Run the Test**:
   - Run the test to confirm that it fails. This step verifies that the test is valid and that it will correctly detect the absence of the required functionality.

3. **Write the Minimum Code to Pass the Test**:
   - Implement just enough code to make the test pass.
   - The focus is on simplicity and functionality, without worrying about optimizations or additional features.

4. **Run All Tests**:
   - Run all the tests, including the new one, to ensure that the new code doesn¡¯t break any existing functionality.
   - If any tests fail, adjust the code until all tests pass.

5. **Refactor the Code**:
   - Once the test passes, review the code and refactor it for clarity, efficiency, and maintainability.
   - The tests act as a safety net during refactoring, ensuring that the functionality remains intact.

6. **Repeat the Process**:
   - Continue the cycle by writing the next test, implementing the corresponding code, and refactoring.

### Benefits of Test-Driven Development

- **Improved Code Quality**: TDD encourages developers to write cleaner, more modular code since the focus is on passing small, specific tests.
- **Reduced Bugs**: Writing tests first ensures that the code meets its requirements, reducing the likelihood of bugs.
- **Confidence in Changes**: Tests provide a safety net when making changes to the codebase, ensuring that existing functionality isn¡¯t broken.
- **Better Design**: TDD naturally leads to a more thoughtful design process, as developers must consider how the code will be tested from the outset.

### Example in Practice (Using Python)

Here¡¯s a simple example of how TDD might be used to develop a function that adds two numbers.

1. **Write a Test**:
   ```python
   def test_add_two_numbers():
       assert add(2, 3) == 5
   ```

2. **Run the Test**:
   - At this point, running the test will result in an error because the `add` function doesn¡¯t exist yet.

3. **Write the Minimum Code to Pass the Test**:
   ```python
   def add(a, b):
       return a + b
   ```

4. **Run All Tests**:
   - Now, running the test again should pass, confirming that the function works as expected.

5. **Refactor (if needed)**:
   - In this case, the function is simple, so no refactoring is necessary.

6. **Repeat**:
   - Move on to the next piece of functionality, perhaps testing how the function handles non-integer inputs, and repeat the process.

### Conclusion

Test-Driven Development is a disciplined and systematic approach to software development that ensures functionality is built incrementally and verified from the start. By writing tests first, developers can be confident that their code does exactly what it¡¯s supposed to do, leading to more reliable and maintainable software.

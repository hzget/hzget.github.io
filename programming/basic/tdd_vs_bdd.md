TDD vs BDD
===

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** are both software development methodologies that emphasize testing, but they differ in their focus, process, and outcomes. Here's a comparison between the two:

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

#### Focus:
- **Code-Centric**: TDD is primarily focused on writing tests for the specific functionality of the code. It ensures that the code works correctly according to its specifications.

#### Process:
1. **Write a Test**: Start by writing a unit test for a small piece of functionality. The test is usually written at the code level and focuses on individual methods or functions.
2. **Run the Test**: Run the test to ensure it fails, confirming that the functionality is not yet implemented.
3. **Write the Code**: Implement just enough code to make the test pass.
4. **Run All Tests**: Run the tests again to ensure that the new code doesn't break any existing functionality.
5. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while ensuring that all tests still pass.
6. **Repeat**: Continue the cycle for each new piece of functionality.

#### Outcome:
- **Well-Tested Code**: The main outcome of TDD is code that is thoroughly tested at a granular level.
- **Technical Specification**: The tests in TDD serve as a technical specification of what the code does.

#### Example:
- Writing a test for a function that adds two numbers and then implementing the function to pass the test.

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

#### Focus:
- **Behavior-Centric**: BDD is focused on the behavior of the application from the user's perspective. It emphasizes the system's functionality and how it behaves under various conditions.

#### Process:
1. **Define Behavior in Plain Language**: Collaboratively define the desired behavior of a feature in plain, natural language. This is often done using a structured format like "Given-When-Then."
2. **Convert Behavior into Tests**: Translate the defined behavior into automated tests. These tests are often written in a BDD framework that supports the natural language format (e.g., Cucumber, RSpec).
3. **Write the Code**: Implement the code to satisfy the behavior described in the tests.
4. **Run All Tests**: Ensure that the new behavior works and that existing behaviors remain intact.
5. **Refactor**: Refine the code while ensuring that the behavior still meets the requirements.
6. **Repeat**: Continue defining and implementing behaviors iteratively.

#### Outcome:
- **Well-Defined Behavior**: The main outcome of BDD is software that clearly aligns with the expected behavior from the user's perspective.
- **Business Specification**: BDD tests serve as a specification of what the software should do in terms of business requirements or user stories.

#### Example:
- Defining a user story like "As a user, I want to add two numbers so that I can see the sum" and then writing tests to verify that this behavior works as expected.

### Key Differences

1. **Perspective**:
   - **TDD** is developer-centric and focuses on the correctness of individual units of code.
   - **BDD** is user-centric and focuses on the behavior of the application as a whole, often from the perspective of the end user or stakeholder.

2. **Language**:
   - **TDD** uses technical language to describe tests, usually focused on the internals of the code.
   - **BDD** uses natural language to describe tests, making them more accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

3. **Scope**:
   - **TDD** typically focuses on unit tests, which test small pieces of code in isolation.
   - **BDD** often encompasses broader tests that verify the application's behavior, potentially involving multiple components.

4. **Collaboration**:
   - **TDD** is usually performed by developers, with less direct involvement from non-technical stakeholders.
   - **BDD** encourages collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders to ensure that the software meets user needs.

### Conclusion

- **TDD** is best when you need to ensure that your code works correctly at a granular level and is particularly useful for developers focusing on technical correctness.
- **BDD** is ideal when you want to ensure that your software behaves as expected from a user's perspective, fostering collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Both methodologies can be used together, with BDD guiding the overall design and behavior of the system, and TDD ensuring that the individual components are implemented correctly.

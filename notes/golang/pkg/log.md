# log

Package [log][std/log] implements a simple logging package.

A Logger represents an active logging object that generates
lines of ***formatted output*** to an io.Writer, which writes
to the underlying data stream. It can be used in many situations
besides the console log.

The output "format" is a plain text message with prefix.
And there're flags define which text to prefix to each log entry
generated by the Logger. Here is an example:

```golang
// write to standard error
log.Println("here is a log to std err")
// output: 2022/10/24 22:45:49 here is a log to std err

// write to bytes.Buffer that implements io.Writer
var buf bytes.Buffer
logger := log.New(&buf, "[logger] ", log.Ltime|log.Lmicroseconds)
logger.Printf("here is a log to bytes.Buffer")
fmt.Print(&buf)
// output: [logger] 22:45:49.141439 here is a log to bytes.Buffer
```
The format is very simple, thus the pkg is used in very simple
situation. For complex format, like "leveled" log, we need to
refer to other log packages such as [zerolog][zerolog].

# Container

Container is a runnable instance of an image.
Simply put, a container is a sandboxed process
on your machine that is isolated from all other processes
on the host machine.

* portable: the image can be moved to any os to run
* isolation: containers are isolated from each other
* independent: it contains all dependencies to run as a container

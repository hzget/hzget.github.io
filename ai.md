# Aritificial Intelligence

AI plays an increasingly important role in the society and
deserves great attention. If we don't care about it, we'll be
replaced before long. To avoid being defected by AI,
we can join hands with it.

## Intuition

The following two links just give an ***intuition*** about
what ML looks like and how it works under the hood.

|[Machine Learning][Machine Learning]| |[Neural Networks][Neural Networks]| |

|[![apple classifier][apple classifier]][Machine Learning]|A technique that learns rules from examples automatically, which can be applied on new cases.|[![neural network][neural network]][Neural Networks]|A subfield of ML. An implementation: [online handwritten recognition](./neural_networks_intuition/implementation.md). |
